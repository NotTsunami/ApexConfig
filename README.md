# Tsunami's Minimal Apex Legends Config

**As of patch 1.2, most config commands received a flag explicitly disabling them. As a result, this config currently won't achieve much anymore. While it is a [known issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/bxbaer/known_issues_post_patch_12/), the first patch following this only reenabled three commands. If more commands are reenabled that affect FPS, this config will be updated accordingly.**

## How to Use
1. To download the scripts, click the green 'Clone or Download' button, and then click 'Download ZIP'.
2. Drop autoexec.cfg into Apex Legend's cfg folder (Typically located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Apex\cfg`)
3. Add `+exec autoexec` to your launch options (Accessible by hitting the gear cog in Origin for Apex and then going to Game Properties->Advanced Launch Options)

## Important Notes
1. To reset settings, you will either have to flip the values back to their defaults and relaunch, or reinstall the game.
